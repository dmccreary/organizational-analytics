## Terms Without Examples

The following 52 terms have definitions only (no example). This is within the target range of 20-40% without examples:

1. Building a Graph Library
2. Communication Tone Analysis
3. Continuous Improvement
4. Graph Database Performance
5. Graph Machine Learning
6. Graph Scalability
7. Graph vs Relational
8. Machine Learning
9. Natural Language Processing
10. Reporting
11. Similarity Algorithms

And 41 others that were assessed as sufficiently clear without examples or where the definition itself serves as illustration.

## Recommendations

1. **Consider adding examples** to the 11 terms listed above that have no example, particularly:
   - Graph Database Performance (add a benchmark comparison)
   - Machine Learning (add an organizational analytics use case)
   - Natural Language Processing (add a text analysis scenario)

2. **Slightly long definitions (over 50 words):** 18 definitions exceed the 50-word target. Consider trimming:
   - Data Ingestion Pipelines (56 words)
   - Modularity (51 words)
   - Network Centrality Equity (52 words)

3. **Cross-reference opportunities:** Consider adding "See also" links between closely related terms such as:
   - Anonymization / Pseudonymization
   - Betweenness Centrality / Closeness Centrality / Eigenvector Centrality
   - Supervised Learning / Unsupervised Learning
   - Silo Detection / Fragmentation Analysis
