Excited to share a new open educational resource: an interactive intelligent textbook on Organizational Analytics using graph databases and AI!

This textbook tackles a question most HR teams can't answer with their current tools: What's really happening inside your organization? Traditional relational databases store employees as rows — but the real insights live in the relationships between people. This course teaches professionals how to use graph databases, NLP, and machine learning to uncover hidden influencers, detect silos, predict flight risk, and match talent to opportunities.

Built using state-of-the-art Claude Code Skills, the textbook features a 200-concept learning dependency graph, interactive browser-based simulations, and a mascot named Aria — a glamorous leafcutter ant who once optimized her colony's communication network and saved them 40% in lost productivity.

By the numbers:

- 15 chapters from graph fundamentals to capstone projects
- 200 concepts organized in a dependency learning graph
- 70 interactive MicroSims (p5.js and vis-network simulations)
- 150 quiz questions for self-assessment
- 201 glossary terms with ISO 11179-compliant definitions
- 93 frequently asked questions
- 178,000+ words (~766 equivalent printed pages)
- 76 diagrams and visual elements

Topics span employee event streams, graph data modeling, centrality and pathfinding algorithms, community detection, NLP sentiment analysis, graph machine learning, ethics and privacy, dashboards, and real-world talent management applications.

Generated using Claude AI skills and the intelligent textbook framework — demonstrating how AI can accelerate educational content creation while maintaining pedagogical rigor aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy.
