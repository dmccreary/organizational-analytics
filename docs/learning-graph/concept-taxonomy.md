# Concept Taxonomy for Organizational Analytics with AI

This taxonomy organizes the 200 concepts into 12 categories for color-coded visualization in the learning graph.

## Categories

### 1. Foundation Concepts (FOUND)

Foundational prerequisites and introductory concepts that establish the context for the course. Includes traditional HR systems, database paradigms, and the motivation for graph-based analytics.

### 2. Graph Modeling (GMOD)

Core graph database modeling concepts including nodes, edges, properties, schema design, and query languages. These are the building blocks for representing organizational data as a graph.

### 3. Graph Performance (GPERF)

Concepts related to graph database performance, scalability, and indexing. Covers the operational considerations for running graph analytics at enterprise scale.

### 4. Event Streams (EVENT)

Employee event stream concepts including event logs, timestamps, normalization, and the various sources of organizational data (email, chat, devices, calendar, business processes).

### 5. Data Pipelines (DPIPE)

Data engineering concepts for moving event data into graph databases. Covers ETL, staging, batch vs. stream processing, data quality, and latency management.

### 6. Organizational Modeling (OMOD)

Concepts for modeling the organizational domain: employees, departments, positions, communication patterns, projects, and task assignments within the graph.

### 7. Ethics and Privacy (ETHIC)

Ethical considerations, privacy frameworks, consent, anonymization, bias, and transparency. Sets the boundaries for responsible use of employee analytics.

### 8. Security (SECUR)

Technical security concepts including access control, encryption, audit trails, record retention, and data minimization.

### 9. Graph Algorithms (GALG)

The algorithmic core of the course: centrality measures, pathfinding, community detection, similarity, and network metrics used to extract insights from organizational graphs.

### 10. NLP and Machine Learning (NLPML)

Natural language processing and machine learning concepts applied to organizational data. Includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, LLMs, graph neural networks, and embeddings.

### 11. Organizational Insights (INSGT)

The analytical insights derived from graph and NLP techniques: influence detection, silo detection, vulnerability analysis, flight risk, retention, and information flow analysis.

### 12. Applied HR Analytics (APPHR)

Applied HR use cases that combine multiple techniques: mentoring, placement, career guidance, onboarding effectiveness, merger integration, and inclusion analytics.

### 13. Reporting and Dashboards (RPTDASH)

Concepts for presenting insights: reporting, dashboards, visualization, real-time discovery, pattern and anomaly detection, and alerting.

### 14. Capstone and Integration (CAPST)

Capstone-level concepts that integrate multiple skills: building graph libraries, end-to-end pipelines, organizational health scores, AI event detection, and continuous improvement.
