# Graph Algorithms: Community and Similarity

## Summary

This chapter builds on centrality and pathfinding to cover algorithms that detect structure and patterns in organizational networks. Students learn about clustering coefficients, community detection (Louvain, label propagation, modularity), and how to label discovered communities. The chapter also covers similarity algorithms (Jaccard, cosine, node similarity), graph metrics like network density and average path length, connected components, subgraph analysis, and motif detection.

This chapter covers the following 19 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Clustering Coefficient

3. Louvain Algorithm
4. Label Propagation
5. Modularity
6. Labeling Communities
7. Similarity Algorithms
8. Jaccard Similarity
9. Cosine Similarity
10. Node Similarity
11. Similar People
12. Similar Roles
13. Similar Events
14. Graph Metrics
15. Network Density
16. Average Path Length
17. Connected Components
18. Subgraph Analysis
19. Motif Detection
