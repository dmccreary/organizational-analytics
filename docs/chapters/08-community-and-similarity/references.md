4. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition - Ronald Burt - Harvard University Press (1992) - Foundational work on how bridging positions between communities create competitive advantage. Burt's framework informs how community boundaries and boundary-spanning roles are identified and valued.

5. The Hidden Power of Social Networks - Rob Cross and Andrew Parker - Harvard Business Review Press (2004) - Chapter 5 covers cross-boundary collaboration patterns and how to detect and bridge organizational silos using network analysis, directly applicable to community detection interpretation.

6. [Clustering Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient) - Wikipedia - Measures the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. High clustering coefficients indicate tightly-knit teams; low values suggest fragmented or loosely connected groups.

7. [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) - Wikipedia - Explains the vector-based similarity measure used to compare employees based on feature profiles such as skills, communication patterns, or project involvement regardless of magnitude.

8. [Label Propagation Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_propagation_algorithm) - Wikipedia - Fast community detection method where nodes adopt the most frequent label among their neighbors. Useful for rapid exploratory analysis of organizational community structure.

9. [Modularity (networks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)) - Wikipedia - Mathematical measure of how well a network decomposes into communities. Provides the objective function that algorithms like Louvain optimize when detecting organizational clusters.
