# Machine Learning and Graph ML

## Summary

This chapter covers machine learning fundamentals and their application to graph-structured organizational data. Students learn about supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, training and evaluation, and then advance to graph-specific ML techniques including graph neural networks, node embeddings, link prediction, and graph classification. The chapter also addresses bias in analytics as a critical consideration when applying ML to HR data.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Machine Learning
2. Supervised Learning
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Feature Engineering
5. Training and Evaluation
6. Graph Machine Learning
7. Graph Neural Networks
8. Node Embeddings
9. Link Prediction
10. Graph Classification
11. Bias in Analytics
