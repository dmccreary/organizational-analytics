## How to Use This Textbook

Chapters are sequenced so that each chapter builds on concepts from earlier chapters. Foundational topics like graph databases and event streams appear first, followed by algorithms and NLP, then applied insights and capstone projects. You can follow the chapters in order for a complete learning path, or jump to specific chapters if you already have prerequisite knowledge.
