# Organizational Insights

## Summary

This chapter applies graph algorithms and NLP techniques to extract actionable organizational insights. Students learn to detect influence patterns, identify informal leaders, bridge builders, and boundary spanners. The chapter covers information flow analysis, communication bottlenecks, efficiency metrics, silo detection, fragmentation analysis, vulnerability assessment, single points of failure, knowledge concentration, succession planning, flight risk detection, disengagement signals, turnover contagion, and retention analytics.
