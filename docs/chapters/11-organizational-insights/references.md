1. [Organizational Network Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_network_analysis) - Wikipedia - Overview of ONA methods for diagnosing organizational dynamics including influence mapping, silo detection, bottleneck identification, and key connector analysis — the core applied techniques in this chapter.

2. [Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) - Wikipedia - Covers strategies for capturing, distributing, and retaining organizational knowledge. Directly relevant to understanding knowledge flow networks, single points of failure, and institutional knowledge risk.

3. [Employee Retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_retention) - Wikipedia - Examines factors affecting retention including engagement, career development, and organizational culture. Provides context for the graph-based flight risk and retention analysis methods in this chapter.

4. The Hidden Power of Social Networks - Rob Cross and Andrew Parker - Harvard Business Review Press (2004) - The primary reference for this chapter. Cross and Parker's diagnostic framework for identifying central connectors, boundary spanners, bottlenecks, and peripheral isolates directly informs every organizational insight technique covered here.

5. The Strength of Weak Ties - Mark Granovetter - American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 78, No. 6 (1973) - Landmark paper demonstrating that weak inter-group ties carry novel information and opportunity. Explains why boundary-spanning connections detected by graph analysis are disproportionately valuable for innovation and information flow.

6. [Silo (organizational)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo) - Wikipedia - Explains information silos where data and communication remain trapped within organizational units. Provides conceptual framework for the graph-based silo detection methods using cross-boundary edge density.

7. [Single Point of Failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) - Wikipedia - Engineering concept applied to organizational networks where removing one person would disconnect critical communication paths. Motivates the vulnerability and key-person dependency analysis in this chapter.

8. [Structural Holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_holes) - Wikipedia - Burt's theory of competitive advantage from bridging disconnected groups. Core theoretical lens for identifying and valuing boundary spanners and information brokers in organizational networks.

9. [Employee Engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_engagement) - Wikipedia - Covers engagement measurement approaches and their relationship to productivity and retention. Provides context for understanding how network position (central vs. peripheral) correlates with engagement levels.

10. [Turnover (employment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(employment)) - Wikipedia - Examines voluntary and involuntary turnover patterns, costs, and predictive factors. Background for the graph-based flight risk models that use network disengagement signals as early warning indicators.
