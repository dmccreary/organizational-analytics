5. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition - Ronald Burt - Harvard University Press (1992) - Burt demonstrates that innovation and competitive advantage flow from boundary-spanning positions that bridge structural holes.

6. [Diffusion of Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) - Wikipedia - Rogers' theory of how ideas spread through social networks via innovators, early adopters, and majority. Applicable to tracing idea flow patterns and identifying innovation catalysts in organizational graphs.

[The Strength of Weak Ties (Granovetter, 1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strength_of_Weak_Ties_(1973)) - Wikipedia - Granovetter's foundational insight that novel information flows through weak inter-group ties explains why boundary-spanning connections are the primary channels for organizational innovation.
