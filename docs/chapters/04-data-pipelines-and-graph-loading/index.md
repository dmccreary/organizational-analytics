# Data Pipelines and Graph Loading

## Summary

This chapter covers the data engineering required to move employee event streams into a graph database. Students learn about staging areas, ETL processes tailored for graph data, and the trade-offs between batch loading and stream processing. The chapter also addresses real-time data ingestion, latency management, data quality checks, and deduplication strategies.
