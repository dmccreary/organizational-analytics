# Graph Algorithms: Centrality and Pathfinding

## Summary

This chapter introduces the algorithmic core of organizational analytics. Students learn how graph algorithms reveal hidden patterns in organizational networks. The chapter covers degree centrality (indegree and outdegree), betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, PageRank, and pathfinding algorithms including shortest path, Dijkstra, breadth-first search, and depth-first search.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 13 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Graph Algorithms
