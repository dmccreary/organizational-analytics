# Graph Database Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter covers the core building blocks of graph databases: nodes, edges, properties, and the relationships between them. Students learn about directed and undirected graphs, weighted edges, DAGs, schema design, and the property graph model. The chapter also introduces graph query languages (including Cypher), graph traversals, and performance considerations including indexing and scalability.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 17 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Graph Data Model
2. Nodes
3. Edges
4. Node Properties
5. Edge Properties
6. Directed Graphs
7. Undirected Graphs
8. Directed Acyclic Graphs
9. Weighted Edges
10. Graph Schema Design
11. Property Graph Model
12. Graph Query Language
13. Cypher Query Language
14. Graph Traversals
15. Graph Database Performance
16. Indexing in Graphs
17. Graph Scalability
