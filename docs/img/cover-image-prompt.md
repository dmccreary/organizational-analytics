## Prompt

Please generate a new wide landscape book cover illustration for "Organizational Analytics with AI," an intelligent textbook about using graph databases and AI to reveal hidden networks inside organizations.  Width:height ratio of 1.91:1

**Layout — three zones, left to right:**

LEFT ZONE (roughly the left 25% of the image): Leave this area as a clean, softly blurred or subtly gradient background in deep indigo (#303F9F) fading to slightly lighter indigo. This space is reserved for the mascot character who is uploaded in this session. Keep it uncluttered with no text or foreground elements.

CENTER-RIGHT ZONE (roughly the center 50% to right 75%): The book title "Organizational Analytics" in large, bold, clean white sans-serif typography (like Inter, Montserrat, or Roboto). Below it in smaller white text: "with AI" in a warm amber/gold (#D4880F) accent color. Below that in even smaller white text: "An Interactive Intelligent Textbook" and "Dan McCreary". The text should be clearly legible against the background.

BACKGROUND (full width, behind all elements): A sophisticated montage collage of semi-transparent, overlapping imagery at about 20-30% opacity, blending into a deep indigo-to-dark-navy gradient. The montage elements should include:

1. **Network graph visualization** — glowing nodes connected by edges, resembling an organizational communication network, with nodes in amber/gold and edges in soft white or light blue. This should be the most prominent background element.

2. **Silhouettes of diverse professionals** — small groups of 3-4 people in business attire, standing and collaborating, suggesting teamwork and organizational structure. Subtle, not dominant.

3. **Organizational chart fragments** — partial org chart boxes and connecting lines, slightly tilted or faded, suggesting the formal structure that the book looks beyond.

4. **Data dashboard elements** — fragments of bar charts, line graphs, and metric cards floating in the background, suggesting analytics and reporting.

5. **Digital communication icons** — subtle email envelope icons, chat bubble icons, and mobile device silhouettes, representing the employee event streams that feed the analytics.

6. **AI/neural network motif** — a subtle pattern of interconnected dots and lines in the upper right corner, suggesting artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a slight glow effect.

7. **Graph database schema fragment** — a small cluster of labeled nodes (Person, Department, Project, Communication) with typed edges between them, rendered as a clean diagram partially visible in the lower right.

The overall color palette should be deep indigo (#303F9F) as the dominant background color, with amber/gold (#D4880F) highlights on key network nodes and accent elements, white for text and secondary graph edges, and hints of champagne warmth (#FFF8E7) in glowing elements. The feel should be professional, sophisticated, and inviting — like a premium technology book cover, not a textbook.

The montage elements should feel layered and atmospheric, not cluttered. Think of them as ghostly impressions behind the title, creating visual richness without competing with the text. The deepest/darkest area should be the left zone where the mascot will be placed.

## Compositing Notes

After generating the background + title image:

1. **Aria placement:** Composite the Aria character PNG (transparent background) onto the left zone, sized so she occupies roughly the left 20-25% of the image width. Her feet should be near the bottom edge, head near the top third. She should appear to be standing confidently, presenting the title to her right.

2. **Shadow/glow:** Add a subtle warm amber glow behind Aria to integrate her with the indigo background and make her iridescent exoskeleton pop.

3. **Final check:** Ensure the title text remains fully legible and Aria doesn't overlap the text.

## Alternative: Single-Prompt Version (if compositing isn't available)

Wide landscape book cover. Deep indigo (#303F9F) gradient background. On the left side, a glamorous anthropomorphic ant character with an iridescent amber exoskeleton wearing a tailored deep indigo blazer, standing confidently and gesturing toward the center. In the center-right, large bold white text reading "Organizational Analytics" with "with AI" in warm gold below it. The background features a semi-transparent montage of glowing network graphs with amber nodes, silhouettes of collaborating professionals, fragments of org charts and data dashboards, email and chat icons, and AI neural network patterns. The overall mood is professional, sophisticated, and warmly inviting. Style: modern digital illustration, clean and premium.
