Please create two new appendices

Put one in @docs/appendices/visualizing-graph-networks/index.md

The first one is about "Visualizing Graph Networks" - it
is an overview of how we use different layout algorithms to visualize
a graph network.  Include a summary algorithms like:
- Force directed layout
- Hierarchal layout
- Circle layouts

The second one is about "Popular JavaScript Libraries"
@docs/appendices/popular-javascript-libraries/index.md

Add a section on 
## History of Graph Visualization
that description of the original work on GraphViz within Bell Labs and the dot notation

## Modern JavaScript Libraries
Include a list of the main specialty purpose libraries that
really are dedicated to drawing graph networks.  For each
library list the pros and cons and who the intended audience is.
