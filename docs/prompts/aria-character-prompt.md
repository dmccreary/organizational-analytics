## Prompt

Full-body character illustration of a glamorous anthropomorphic female leafcutter ant standing upright on two legs in a confident, welcoming pose with one hand on her hip and the other gesturing outward as if presenting an idea. She has a stunning hourglass figure with a slender thorax cinched between an elegantly rounded head and abdomen, carrying herself with effortless poise and confidence. She is a beauty queen who also happens to be a data scientist.

Her exoskeleton is luminous iridescent amber with warm golden highlights and subtle honey-brown undertones that catch the light, giving her a radiant, polished glow. Her surface has a smooth, slightly reflective quality like brushed amber gemstone.

She has large, sparkling dark brown eyes with long elegant lashes, full of warmth and intelligence. Her two delicate antennae curve gracefully upward from her forehead, with subtle curls at the tips suggesting amusement and curiosity. She has a friendly, confident smile.

She wears a perfectly tailored deep indigo blazer (hex #303F9F) with clean lapels and a tiny gold graph-node brooch pinned on the left lapel — the brooch is a small circle (node) with three short lines (edges) radiating from it. The blazer fits her hourglass figure beautifully. Beneath the blazer she wears a simple white blouse.

She carries a miniature messenger bag in warm amber leather slung crossbody over one shoulder. A gold pen is tucked behind her right antenna. Round reading glasses with thin gold frames are pushed up on top of her head.

She has six limbs total: two arms in an expressive, welcoming gesture, two middle limbs relaxed at her sides (one holding a small stylish clipboard), and two legs in a poised standing stance. She wears small indigo ankle boots.

The character should feel aspirational, intelligent, warm, and fashion-forward — like a tiny corporate executive who also happens to be an ant. The overall vibe is professional glamour meets approachable warmth. Think Pixar-quality character design with the charm of a Disney heroine.

Transparent background, no shadows on the ground, no background elements. Full body visible from antennae tips to boots. Clean edges suitable for compositing over other images.
