# Continuous Improvement Cycle

<iframe src="main.html" height="502px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

[Run the Continuous Improvement Cycle MicroSim Fullscreen](./main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Description

This interactive MicroSim visualizes the four-phase continuous improvement cycle for organizational analytics: Measure, Analyze, Intervene, and Evaluate. Each phase is displayed as a node in a circular layout with curved arrows showing the clockwise flow. Click any phase to see detailed steps and example scenarios. A subtle rotating animation around the center reinforces that this cycle never ends.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will evaluate organizational health metrics over time and design improvement interventions based on analytical insights, then measure their effectiveness.

### Activities
1. Click each phase to read the detailed steps involved
2. Trace the cycle clockwise and explain why it loops continuously
3. Using the example scenario (Resilience dropped to 55), walk through all four phases
4. Discuss what happens if an organization skips the Evaluate phase
5. Design your own improvement cycle for a specific organizational dimension
