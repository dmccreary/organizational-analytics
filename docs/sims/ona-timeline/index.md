## Description

This interactive timeline traces the evolution of Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) across nine decades, from Jacob Moreno's foundational sociometry work in 1934 to today's AI-powered organizational graph digital twins. Events are grouped into eight categories — Foundations, Theory, Methods, ONA Practice, Data & Platforms, Products, Workplace, and AI Era — so you can see how academic theory, practitioner tools, and technology platforms co-evolved.

### How to Use

- **Pan** the timeline by clicking and dragging
- **Zoom** using the + / &minus; buttons (scroll wheel works in fullscreen mode)
- **Hover** over any event to see a context tooltip
- **Click** an event to view full details in the panel below
- **Filter** by category using the buttons above the timeline

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this activity students will be able to:

1. **Trace** the major milestones in the development of organizational network analysis
2. **Explain** how theoretical advances (e.g., Granovetter's weak ties, Burt's structural holes) shaped ONA practice
3. **Identify** the technology shifts that made large-scale ONA feasible (digital exhaust, graph databases, AI)
4. **Evaluate** the impact of remote/hybrid work on collaboration analytics

### Activities

1. **Guided Exploration** — Have students filter to "Theory" and summarize each milestone in their own words
2. **Gap Analysis** — Ask students to identify a period or topic that is underrepresented and propose an event that should be added
3. **Connecting the Dots** — Students pick two events from different categories and write a paragraph explaining how they are related
4. **Modern Extension** — Students research one development from 2024-2025 and draft a JSON entry to extend the timeline

### Assessment

- Short-answer: Explain why the 2010s saw an explosion in commercial ONA tools
- Reflection: How did the COVID-19 pandemic change the kinds of questions organizations ask about collaboration networks?
