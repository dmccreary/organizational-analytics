## How to Use

1. **Hover over a word** to see its three nearest neighbors with connecting lines and similarity scores
2. **Click a word** to pin it and display all similarity scores in a detail panel
3. **Drag the similarity threshold slider** at the bottom to show only connections above a certain strength
4. **Read the legend** to identify the four vocabulary clusters: Leadership, Technical, Financial, and People

## About

Word embeddings represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space where semantically similar words cluster together. When projected to 2D, organizational vocabulary naturally forms clusters around domains like leadership, technical work, finance, and people management. These embeddings power NLP tasks in organizational analytics, such as classifying communication topics, finding related concepts, and detecting when language patterns shift across teams or time periods.
