# Executive Dashboard

The **Executive Dashboard** demonstrates how organizational analytics insights are distilled into a real-time visual interface for senior leaders. Six key performance indicators map directly to graph algorithm outputs -- centrality, community detection, sentiment analysis, and retention risk models -- following progressive disclosure and Tufte's data-ink principles.

## How to Use

1. **Scan the KPI cards** -- each card shows a primary metric value, status indicator (green/amber/red circle), sparkline trend, and target reference. The dashboard answers "Is everything okay?" in under five seconds.
2. **Click any KPI card** to drill down into the department-level breakdown below. A bar chart shows each department's contribution to the aggregate metric with color-coded bars and a dashed target line.
3. **Adjust the time range** using the 4-week, 8-week, or 12-week buttons to change sparkline resolution.
4. **Toggle "vs. Last Quarter"** to overlay previous quarter values for comparison on each KPI card.
5. **Click a selected card again** or the close button to dismiss the detail panel.

## About This Simulation

Executive dashboards follow four design principles: progressive disclosure (overview first, detail on demand), Tufte's data-ink ratio (maximize data, minimize decoration), Gestalt grouping (proximity clusters related metrics), and consistent visual encoding (amber always means warning). This simulation demonstrates all four principles while presenting the six KPIs described in Chapter 14: Collaboration Index, Network Resilience, Silo Risk, Retention Health, Innovation Flow, and Sentiment Pulse.
