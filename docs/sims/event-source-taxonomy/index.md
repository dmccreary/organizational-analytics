## Description

This interactive tree diagram shows the hierarchical taxonomy of organizational event sources, organized into three main categories: Communication Streams (indigo), Device & Application Streams (amber), and Business Process Streams (gold). Each branch can be expanded to reveal specific event types.

**How to use:**

- **Click** any branch node to expand or collapse its children
- **Hover** over any node to see a tooltip with details about that event category
- Use **Expand All / Collapse All** buttons to quickly view the full tree or reset

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will categorize the major types of organizational event sources and identify the kinds of events each produces.

**Bloom's Level:** Analyze (L4)

**Activities:**

1. Start with all branches collapsed and ask students to predict what event types fall under each category
2. Expand each branch and compare predictions with actual event types
3. Discuss which event sources would be most valuable for analyzing cross-team collaboration

**Assessment:** Given a new organizational tool (e.g., a project management platform), ask students to classify where it would fit in the taxonomy and list its expected event types.
