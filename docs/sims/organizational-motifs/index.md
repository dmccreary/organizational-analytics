## About

Network motifs are small, recurring subgraph patterns that appear frequently in organizational communication networks. Just as molecules are built from atoms in characteristic arrangements, organizational networks are built from these fundamental building blocks. Identifying which motifs dominate in a department or team reveals its communication culture -- whether it favors collaboration, hierarchy, brokerage, or broadcasting.

## The Five Motifs

| Motif | Pattern | Organizational Meaning |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Triangle** | 3 nodes, all connected | Trust and team cohesion |
| **Feed-forward Loop** | Chain with redundant direct link | Mentoring with oversight |
| **Reciprocal Pair** | Two nodes, bidirectional | Partnership and co-leadership |
| **Fan-out Star** | Hub broadcasting to spokes | Top-down communication |
| **Broker Triad** | One node bridging two disconnected nodes | Information gatekeeping |
