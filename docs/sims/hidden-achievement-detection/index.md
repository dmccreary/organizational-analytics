## About This MicroSim

This interactive flowchart visualizes the five-stage pipeline for detecting hidden achievements in organizational networks. The pipeline progresses from raw communication graph data through centrality analysis, recognition history overlay, gap detection, and finally to actionable recognition recommendations.

Hover over each stage to see sample data artifacts, and click a stage to highlight the data flow between adjacent pipeline stages.

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over any stage to see a tooltip showing sample data at that point in the pipeline
2. **Click** a stage to select it -- this highlights the connecting arrows and animates data flow particles between adjacent stages
3. **Click again** on a selected stage (or click empty space) to deselect
4. **Reset** button clears all selections

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will differentiate between formally recognized contributions and hidden achievements detectable through graph patterns, analyzing the complete pipeline for surfacing unrecognized contributors.

### Activities

1. **Explore the Pipeline**: Hover over each stage to understand what data enters and exits
2. **Trace the Flow**: Click each stage to see how data transforms as it moves through the pipeline
3. **Discussion**: Why might high-centrality employees go unrecognized? What organizational factors contribute to recognition gaps?

### Assessment

- Explain the role of each pipeline stage in detecting hidden achievements
- Describe what graph metrics are most useful for identifying bridge builders
- Propose additional data sources that could improve the gap detection stage
