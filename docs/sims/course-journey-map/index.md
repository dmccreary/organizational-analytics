## About This MicroSim

This interactive roadmap gives you a bird's-eye view of the entire course. Five phases take you from foundational concepts all the way to building real analytical applications. Hover over each phase node to see which chapters it covers and what you'll learn.

Think of this as your trail map for the journey ahead. You'll start with foundations, build up your data pipeline, learn powerful graph algorithms, add intelligence with NLP and ML, and finish by creating professional-grade analytics tools.

## The Five Phases

| Phase | Chapters | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **1. Foundations** | 1-3 | What is organizational analytics, why graphs, how to model people data |
| **2. Data Pipeline** | 4-5 | Employee event streams and graph loading |
| **3. Algorithms** | 6-7 | Centrality, community detection, pathfinding, similarity |
| **4. Intelligence** | 8-11 | NLP, machine learning, and real organizational questions |
| **5. Application** | 12-15 | Reporting, ethics, reusable analytics libraries, capstone |

## Lesson Plan

**Bloom Level:** Remember (L1)

**Learning Objective:** Students will identify the major topic areas of the course and describe how they build on one another.
