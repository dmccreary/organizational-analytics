## How to Use

1. **Compare the two panels** -- the left shows a plain structural graph, the right shows the same graph enriched with NLP properties
2. **Click the view mode buttons** (Sentiment, Topic, Tone) to change how edges display in the right panel
3. **Click any edge** in the right panel to see a detailed NLP property card with sentiment score, emotion, topic, and tone
4. **Drag nodes** in either panel to rearrange the layout

## About

NLP enrichment transforms a plain organizational communication graph into a rich analytical resource. The structural graph on the left only knows that two people communicated and through which channel. After NLP processing, every communication edge gains properties like sentiment score, detected emotion, topic classification, and formality level. These properties enable powerful graph queries such as "Find all paths between departments where average sentiment is negative" or "Which mentoring relationships have the highest trust scores?"
