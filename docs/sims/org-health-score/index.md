## Description

This interactive dashboard visualizes a composite organizational health score combining five graph-derived dimensions: Connectivity, Information Flow, Community Health, Sentiment, and Resilience. Features include a circular gauge with color zones, a radar/spider chart comparing current and previous periods, horizontal dimension bars with trend arrows, a 12-month sparkline showing score history, and an alerts panel highlighting areas of concern and improvement.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will construct a composite organizational health score from multiple graph-derived metrics and interpret the resulting dashboard to identify areas of organizational strength and concern.

### Activities
1. Examine the circular gauge and discuss what the composite score of 72 means
2. Compare the radar chart polygons to identify which dimensions improved or declined
3. Use the dimension bars to identify the weakest area (Resilience at 55)
4. Read the alerts and propose interventions for the flagged issues
5. Toggle between Organization/Department/Team views to discuss how scores might differ at each level
