# BFS vs DFS Traversal Animator

## How to Use

1. **Click "Start"** to begin both traversals simultaneously
2. **Click "Step"** to advance both traversals one step at a time
3. **Watch the queue (BFS)** and **stack (DFS)** update in real time
4. **Use the speed slider** to control animation speed
5. **Click "Reset"** to start over

## About

BFS explores the graph level by level using a queue (FIFO), guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs. DFS explores deeply along each path using a stack (LIFO), useful for cycle detection and exhaustive path enumeration. Watch how the same graph produces different visit orders.
