## How to Use

1. **Read each question** and click "Yes" or "No" to navigate the decision tree
2. **Follow the highlighted path** to reach an algorithm recommendation
3. **Read the recommendation card** for the algorithm and when to use it
4. **Click "Reset"** to try a different path through the tree

## About

With six centrality measures and four pathfinding algorithms, choosing the right one depends on your organizational question. This decision tree guides you from question to algorithm by asking about what you're measuring, whether edges are weighted, and what structural property matters most.
