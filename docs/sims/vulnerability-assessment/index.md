## How to Use

1. **Click any step** in the flowchart to reveal the Cypher query or algorithm details used at that stage
2. **Use the Step Through button** to walk through the assessment process one step at a time, with each step highlighted and its details shown automatically
3. **Use the Reset button** to return to the starting state and clear all highlights
4. **Follow the decision branches** -- "Yes" paths branch right to action boxes, while "No" paths continue straight down the main flow

## About

Organizational vulnerability assessment is the systematic process of identifying structural weaknesses in a company's people network. This flowchart walks through three critical analyses that graph databases excel at:

- **Articulation Point Analysis** finds single points of failure (SPOFs) -- people whose departure would disconnect parts of the communication network
- **Knowledge Concentration Analysis** identifies skills and expertise held by dangerously few people, flagging areas where knowledge transfer programs are needed
- **Succession Gap Analysis** evaluates whether leadership roles have viable internal successors ready to step up

Each analysis leverages Cypher queries against the organizational graph to surface vulnerabilities that traditional HR systems miss entirely. The final output is an Organizational Resilience Score that quantifies how well-prepared the organization is for unexpected departures.
