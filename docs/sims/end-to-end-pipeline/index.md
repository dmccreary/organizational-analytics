[Run the End-to-End Analytics Pipeline MicroSim Fullscreen](./main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Description

This interactive MicroSim visualizes the complete data flow from raw organizational events to actionable insights on a dashboard. Six stages — Raw Events, Staging & Normalization, Graph Loading, Algorithm Execution, Insight Generation, and Delivery — are connected by arrows with a continuous feedback loop. Hover over any stage to see the relevant chapter reference, and click a stage to expand its detail panel. A timeline bar at the bottom shows processing cadence (real-time, scheduled, on-demand).

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will construct a complete end-to-end organizational analytics pipeline from raw event ingestion through insight delivery.

### Activities
1. Explore each stage by hovering to see which chapters cover the skills
2. Click stages to expand and see sub-steps and data transformations
3. Identify the cadence timeline and discuss why different stages run at different frequencies
4. Trace the feedback loop and explain why it transforms a static tool into a learning system
