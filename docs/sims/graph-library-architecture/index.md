# Graph Library Architecture

<iframe src="main.html" height="502px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

[Run the Graph Library Architecture MicroSim Fullscreen](./main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Description

This interactive MicroSim visualizes the five-tier architecture of a reusable organizational analytics graph library. From the Graph Database at the bottom through the Query Library, Functions & Scoring, API Layer, to Consumers at the top, students can explore how each layer builds on the one below it. Hover over any tier to see a description, and click on query categories to expand and see individual queries.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will design a modular graph library architecture that organizes reusable queries, functions, and tests into a maintainable system.

### Activities
1. Explore each tier by hovering to understand its purpose
2. Click query categories to see individual query examples
3. Identify how Config/Tests connect to the middle tiers
4. Discuss why modularity and parameterization matter
