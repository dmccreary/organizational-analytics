## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization shows how novel ideas flow through an organizational network. Node size represents idea origination frequency, and edge thickness shows the volume of novel concepts shared between individuals. The dark background with golden edges creates a "flow" metaphor that highlights innovation pathways.

Use the toggle button to switch between showing all communication edges and showing only idea flow edges. Adjust the threshold slider to progressively reveal only the strongest innovation channels. Hover over nodes to see individual metrics, and drag nodes to explore the network structure.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will assess idea flow patterns in an organizational network, identifying innovation hubs, idea deserts, and optimal diffusion pathways.

### Activities
1. **Identify the Innovation Hub**: Find the node labeled "Innovation Hub" and explore its connections
2. **Find the Idea Desert**: Locate the department with the least incoming novel ideas
3. **Filter by Strength**: Use the threshold slider to find the strongest innovation channels
4. **Cross-Boundary Analysis**: Toggle between views and count cross-department idea flows

### Assessment
- Calculate the cross-boundary flow ratio from the visible edges
- Identify which structural changes would improve idea flow to the Marketing department
- Explain why idea origination rate alone is insufficient to measure innovation
