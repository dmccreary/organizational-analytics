## About

Communication tone profiling captures six dimensions of how teams express themselves: formality, directness, confidence, urgency, empathy, and positivity. These tone scores become properties on communication edges in the organizational graph, enabling queries like "Which teams have the highest empathy scores?" or "How does Engineering's directness compare to HR's?" The dashed gray polygon shows the organizational average, making it easy to spot where individual teams deviate from the norm.
