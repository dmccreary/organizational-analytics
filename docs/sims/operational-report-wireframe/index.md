# Operational Report Wireframe

The **Operational Report Wireframe** demonstrates the structure and content organization of a team-level operational report for organizational analytics. It shows how communication health metrics, network diagnostics, risk indicators, and period-over-period changes are arranged into a coherent reporting template.

## How to Use

1. **Click department buttons** below the report to switch which department is highlighted. The health bar chart, metric cards, and key changes sections all update to reflect the selected department.
2. **Review the health bars** in section 2 to compare internal communication density across all six departments. Bars are color-coded: green (> 0.35), amber (0.15-0.35), and red (< 0.15).
3. **Examine metric cards** in section 3 showing the selected department's connectivity, reachability, brokerage load, and internal density with sparklines and trend arrows.
4. **Scan the risk table** in section 4 for color-coded flight risk scores, disengagement signals, and recognition event counts across all departments.
5. **Toggle "Compare Periods"** to overlay previous period values on the health bars and see prior metric values in the cards.

## About This Simulation

Operational reports are the workhorses of organizational analytics -- they deliver regular, structured updates on team communication health, network diagnostics, risk indicators, and period-over-period changes. This wireframe demonstrates the five-section report template described in Chapter 14, showing how the same underlying graph metrics are structured for managers and HR business partners who need consistent baseline monitoring.
