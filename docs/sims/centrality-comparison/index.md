## How to Use

1. **Click a centrality measure** — "Degree," "Betweenness," or "Closeness" to recolor and resize nodes
2. **Hover over a node** to see all three centrality scores simultaneously
3. **Compare the bar charts** to see how different measures rank different employees as most important

## About

Different centrality measures highlight different people as "important." The hub with many connections, the bridge between departments, and the person closest to everyone are usually different individuals playing complementary roles.
