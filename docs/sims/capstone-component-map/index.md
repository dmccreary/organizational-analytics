## Description

This interactive concept map uses vis-network to show how seven capstone project components — Graph Model, Data Pipeline, Query Library, API Layer, AI Detection, Health Score, and Improvement Cycle — connect to the central Capstone Project node. Each component links to the chapters that provide the necessary skills. Hover over any node to see details and deliverables in the right panel. Click a component to highlight which chapters it depends on.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will integrate all course components into a unified capstone project and trace how each chapter's skills contribute to the final system.

### Activities
1. Hover over each component to read its description and expected deliverable
2. Click a component to see which chapters provide the required skills
3. Trace the dependency flow: Data Pipeline feeds Graph Model, which enables Query Library, etc.
4. Identify which chapters appear most frequently and discuss why they are foundational
5. Plan your own capstone project by selecting which components to prioritize
