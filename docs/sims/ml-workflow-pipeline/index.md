## About

This simulation walks through the six stages of a machine learning pipeline applied to organizational analytics: defining the prediction problem, collecting graph and HR data, engineering features from network metrics, training a model, evaluating with fairness-aware metrics, and deploying with ongoing monitoring. The feedback arrow from Deploy back to Collect Data represents the retrain cycle that keeps models accurate as organizational dynamics shift over time.
