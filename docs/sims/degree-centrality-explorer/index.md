## How to Use

1. **Click a centrality mode** — "Indegree," "Outdegree," or "Total Degree" to recolor and resize nodes
2. **Hover over a node** to see its exact indegree, outdegree, and total degree scores
3. **Observe the rankings** in the top-5 list below the graph to see which employees rank highest under each measure

## About

Degree centrality is the simplest centrality measure — it counts connections. But by distinguishing *incoming* edges (indegree) from *outgoing* edges (outdegree), you can differentiate authority figures (high indegree) from broadcasters (high outdegree) and true communication hubs (high in both).
