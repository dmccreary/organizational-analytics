## How to Use

1. **Drag the sliders** below each gauge to adjust the network metric values
2. **Watch the gauges** update with color-coded zones (green = healthy, yellow = caution, red = concern)
3. **Click "Diagnose"** to get a combined assessment of what the three metrics together indicate about the network

## About

These three metrics together paint a picture of organizational network health. Network density measures connectivity, average path length indicates information flow efficiency, and clustering coefficient reveals how tightly knit local groups are. When read together, specific combinations signal common organizational issues like silos, information bottlenecks, or fragile hub-and-spoke structures.
