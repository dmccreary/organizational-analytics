# Organizational Network Patterns

The **Organizational Network Patterns** visualization demonstrates four common structural motifs that automated pattern detection systems look for in organizational communication networks. Each pattern corresponds to a known organizational phenomenon and has specific detection criteria and business implications.

## How to Use

1. **Select a pattern** using the buttons below the visualization to switch between the four network patterns.
2. **Hourglass** shows two clusters connected by a single bridge node (pulsing in amber). This structural bottleneck means one person brokers all cross-group communication.
3. **Star** shows a hub-and-spoke pattern where a central manager connects all peripheral nodes with few peer-to-peer connections.
4. **Clique Decay** animates a tightly connected group losing edges over three time periods. Use Play/Pause and step controls to walk through the temporal sequence. Dashed lines show lost connections.
5. **Isolation Drift** animates a single node moving from the cluster center toward the periphery, losing connections at each step. The gold trail shows the drift path.
6. **Read the description panel** on the right for detection criteria and business impact for each pattern.

## About This Simulation

Pattern detection is the systematic, automated scanning of organizational graphs for known structural motifs. The hourglass identifies single points of failure for cross-team communication. The star reveals manager-centric information flows. Clique decay signals team fragmentation before it becomes a crisis. Isolation drift surfaces individual disengagement early enough for intervention. Together, these four patterns form the core of a proactive organizational health monitoring system described in Chapter 14.
