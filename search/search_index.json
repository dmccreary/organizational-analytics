Today, most of this work can be cost-effectively outsourced. However, there is a gold mine of untapped data about your staff stored in everyday  tools like your email system, you internal chat history and the event logs that  monitor desktop activity.  Companies almost never tap into this hidden resource. This course is all about mining that treasure and turning it into valuable insights such as:</p> <ol> <li>Recognition - what hidden events should be recognized by leadership</li> <li>Alignment - which tasks created by various teams aligned with the organizational strategy</li> <li>Ideation - how ideas are generated, refined, and recombined across many contributors</li> <li>Influence - reveals who shapes decisions, regardless of formal authority</li> <li>Efficiency - reflects how quickly and directly information flows to accomplish work</li> <li>Innovation - highlights boundary-spanning interactions where novel ideas emerge by  connecting otherwise separate groups</li> <li>Mentoring - how do you match junior employees with senior employees that can help their careers</li> <li>Placement - how to find the perfect person in your organization for a demanding task</li> <li>Sentiment - how can management get an overall sense of the changing attitudes of staff</li> <li>Silos - reveals organizational fragmentation where communication remains trapped within groups</li> <li>Training Gaps - when are people in roles that they don't have sufficient training or background</li> <li>Vulnerability - exposes single points of failure where the organization depends heavily on one individual</li> </ol> <p>This course is about using state-of-the art AI, natural language processing (NLP),  and large-language models (LLMs) to help teams get a real-time sense of what is  going on in their organization.  At the heart of this is a graph database that  can efficiently store the complex relationship-rich data that surrounds people. Through efficient graph algorithms we find that some of the most complex problems can be quickly solved.</p> <p>One of the greatest struggles people have in HR today is the limits of their old relational database.  After taking this course, HR staff will be freed of many of the constraints of the past and be able to answer difficult questions they only dreamed of answering before.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#questions-a-traditional-relational-hris-cannot-answer","title":"Questions a Traditional Relational HRIS Cannot Answer","text":""},{"location":"course-description/#retention-flight-risk","title":"Retention &amp; Flight Risk","text":"<ul> <li>Who is quietly disengaging?
