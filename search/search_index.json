Today, most of this work can be cost-effectively outsourced. However, there is a gold mine of untapped data about your staff stored in everyday  tools like your email system, you internal chat history and the event logs that  monitor desktop activity.  Companies almost never tap into this hidden resource. This course is all about mining that treasure and turning it into valuable insights such as:</p> <ol> <li>Recognition - what hidden events should be recognized by leadership</li> <li>Alignment - which tasks created by various teams aligned with the organizational strategy</li> <li>Ideation - how ideas are generated, refined, and recombined across many contributors</li> <li>Influence - reveals who shapes decisions, regardless of formal authority</li> <li>Efficiency - reflects how quickly and directly information flows to accomplish work</li> <li>Innovation - highlights boundary-spanning interactions where novel ideas emerge by  connecting otherwise separate groups</li> <li>Mentoring - how do you match junior employees with senior employees that can help their careers</li> <li>Placement - how to find the perfect person in your organization for a demanding task</li> <li>Sentiment - how can management get an overall sense of the changing attitudes of staff</li> <li>Silos - reveals organizational fragmentation where communication remains trapped within groups</li> <li>Training Gaps - when are people in roles that they don't have sufficient training or background</li> <li>Vulnerability - exposes single points of failure where the organization depends heavily on one individual</li> </ol> <p>This course is about using state-of-the art AI, natural language processing (NLP),  and large-language models (LLMs) to help teams get a real-time sense of what is  going on in their organization.  At the heart of this is a graph database that  can efficiently store the complex relationship-rich data that surrounds people. Through efficient graph algorithms we find that some of the most complex problems can be quickly solved.</p> <p>One of the greatest struggles people have in HR today is the limits of their old relational database.

Nearly every major HRIS runs on a relational database management system (RDBMS) \u2014 systems like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.</p> <p>Relational databases organize data into tables (also called relations). Each table has rows (records) and columns (fields). Tables are linked together through foreign keys \u2014 a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. To combine data from multiple tables, you write JOIN operations in SQL.</p> <p>Here's a simplified example. Imagine an HR database with two tables:</p> <p>Employees Table</p> emp_id name dept_id title 101 Maria Chen D10 Senior Engineer 102 James Park D10 Engineering Director 103 Aisha Patel D20 Product Manager <p>Departments Table</p> dept_id dept_name head_id D10 Engineering 102 D20 Product 104 <p>To answer \"Who is Maria's department head?\" you'd write:</p> <pre><code>SELECT e.name, d.dept_name, head.name AS department_head\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id\nJOIN employees head ON d.head_id = head.emp_id\nWHERE e.name = 'Maria Chen';\n</code></pre> <p>That's a two-table JOIN, and it works fine.

The trouble begins when you need to traverse relationships \u2014 especially chains of relationships that span multiple hops.</p> <p>Consider this question: \"Who are the people that Maria communicates with, and who do they communicate with?\"</p> <p>This is a two-hop query. In a relational database, you'd need a <code>communications</code> table tracking every exchange, then JOIN it to itself:</p> <pre><code>-- First hop: Who does Maria communicate with?\nSELECT DISTINCT c1.recipient_id\nFROM communications c1\nWHERE c1.sender_id = 101;\n\n-- Second hop: Who do Maria's contacts communicate with?\nSELECT DISTINCT c2.recipient_id\nFROM communications c1\nJOIN communications c2 ON c1.recipient_id = c2.sender_id\nWHERE c1.sender_id = 101;\n</code></pre> <p>That's manageable. But what about three hops? Four? Five? Each additional hop requires another self-JOIN on the communications table, and the performance impact is devastating.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is this: relational databases were designed to store entities and their attributes, not to traverse networks of relationships. Every hop requires a table scan or index lookup to match foreign keys, and the cost compounds multiplicatively with each additional level.</p> <p>Here's what happens to query performance as you increase traversal depth in a relational database with one million employees and ten million communication records:</p> Hops SQL JOINs Required Approximate Response Time (RDBMS) 1 1 self-join ~10 ms 2 2 self-joins ~150 ms 3 3 self-joins ~3 seconds 4 4 self-joins ~45 seconds 5 5 self-joins ~13+ minutes (often times out) <p>By the time you reach five hops \u2014 which is a completely reasonable depth for organizational questions like \"trace the communication path from the CEO to the front-line support team\" \u2014 the relational database has essentially given up.</p> <p>The JOIN Wall</p> <p>The exponential degradation of multi-hop queries in relational databases is sometimes called the \"JOIN wall.\" It's not a bug \u2014 it's a fundamental consequence of how relational storage works. Foreign key lookups require matching values across tables, and each additional hop multiplies the number of comparisons. No amount of indexing or query optimization can eliminate this inherent architectural constraint.</p> <p>But the performance problem is just one dimension. There are several other limitations that make relational databases a poor fit for organizational analytics:</p> <ul> <li>Schema rigidity \u2014 Adding a new type of relationship (say, \"mentors\" or \"influences\") requires altering table structures, creating junction tables, and modifying every query that touches them. In organizational analytics, relationship types evolve constantly.</li> <li>Query complexity \u2014 Even a moderately complex network query in SQL can span dozens of lines and require deep expertise to write correctly. The cognitive overhead discourages exploration.</li> <li>No native path operations \u2014 Finding the shortest communication path between two people, detecting cycles, or identifying connected components all require recursive CTEs or stored procedures that are difficult to write and debug.</li> <li>Aggregation across networks \u2014 Questions like \"What is the average communication distance between departments?\" require global graph operations that simply don't map to SQL's row-and-column paradigm.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapters/01-intro-to-organizational-analytics/#diagram-multi-hop-query-performance-comparison","title":"Diagram: Multi-Hop Query Performance Comparison","text":"Multi-Hop Query Performance Comparison <p>Type: chart</p> <p>Bloom Taxonomy: Analyze (L4) Bloom Verb: compare Learning Objective: Students will compare the query performance of relational databases versus graph databases as traversal depth increases, and analyze why the performance gap widens.</p> <p>Chart type: Bar chart with logarithmic Y-axis</p> <p>Purpose: Dramatically illustrate the performance divergence between RDBMS and graph databases as hop depth increases from 1 to 5.</p> <p>X-axis: \"Number of Hops\" (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Y-axis: \"Query Response Time (milliseconds)\" \u2014 logarithmic scale</p> <p>Data series: 1.
