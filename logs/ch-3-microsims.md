# Chapter 3 MicroSim Generation Log

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Chapter:** 03 — Employee Event Streams
**Generated by:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

## Summary

Generated 5 p5.js MicroSims for all `#### Diagram` elements in Chapter 3. Each MicroSim uses built-in p5.js DOM controls (`createButton`, `createSlider`), follows the standard MicroSim directory structure, and includes full documentation with lesson plans and metadata.

## MicroSims Created

| # | Name | Directory | Bloom Level | Type |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Event Log Anatomy | `docs/sims/event-log-anatomy/` | Understand (L2) | Infographic |
| 2 | Event Source Taxonomy | `docs/sims/event-source-taxonomy/` | Analyze (L4) | Tree diagram |
| 3 | Normalization Pipeline | `docs/sims/normalization-pipeline/` | Apply (L3) | Workflow |
| 4 | Process Discovery Flow | `docs/sims/process-discovery/` | Analyze (L4) | Simulation |
| 5 | Event Stream Pipeline | `docs/sims/event-stream-pipeline/` | Evaluate (L5) | Workflow |

## Files Per MicroSim

Each directory contains:

- `main.html` — Entry point with p5.js 1.11.10 CDN and schema meta tag
- `<name>.js` — p5.js implementation (width-responsive, built-in DOM controls)
- `index.md` — Documentation with iframe embed, fullscreen link, copy-paste iframe, description, lesson plan, references
- `metadata.json` — Dublin Core metadata with educational extensions

## MicroSim Details

### 1. Event Log Anatomy

- **Learning Objective:** Describe the core fields of an event log entry and explain why each is necessary
- **Interactivity:** Hover fields for tooltips; toggle between Email Event and Chat Event examples
- **Visual Design:** Required fields in indigo with solid borders; optional metadata in amber with dashed borders
- **Canvas:** 400 x 485 (drawHeight=440, controlHeight=45)

### 2. Event Source Taxonomy

- **Learning Objective:** Categorize major types of organizational event sources and identify event types each produces
- **Interactivity:** Click branches to expand/collapse; hover for tooltips; Expand All / Collapse All buttons
- **Visual Design:** Three color-coded branches — Communication (indigo), Device & Application (amber), Business Process (gold)
- **Canvas:** 400 x 545 (drawHeight=500, controlHeight=45)

### 3. Normalization and Enrichment Pipeline

- **Learning Objective:** Trace the steps of event normalization and enrichment from raw to graph-ready
- **Interactivity:** Click stages for detail panel with sub-steps and sample JSON; Animate button shows tokens flowing through pipeline
- **Visual Design:** Four-stage horizontal flow — Raw Sources (amber), Normalization (indigo), Enrichment (indigo), Graph-Ready (gold)
- **Canvas:** 400 x 485 (drawHeight=440, controlHeight=45)

### 4. Process Discovery Flow

- **Learning Objective:** Analyze event log data to discover actual business process flow and compare to documented process
- **Interactivity:** Discover Process button animates construction of process map from event log; Show Ideal Process toggle overlays expected flow; Reset to restart
- **Visual Design:** Split panel — event log table (left) and discovered process map (right) with normal flows in indigo and deviations in red
- **Data:** 25 events across 4 hiring process cases with realistic variations (skipped screening, decision loop-back)
- **Canvas:** 400 x 540 (drawHeight=490, controlHeight=50)

### 5. Complete Event Stream Pipeline

- **Learning Objective:** Assess the complete 5-stage pipeline and evaluate the role of each stage
- **Interactivity:** Start/Pause animation; Speed slider (1x–5x); click stages for descriptions; hover tokens for type labels; event counter
- **Visual Design:** Five-stage pipeline with source icons, color-coded event tokens (Email, Chat, Calendar, Device, App), and legend
- **Canvas:** 400 x 490 (drawHeight=440, controlHeight=50)

## Navigation Update

Added to `mkdocs.yml` under MicroSims section:

```yaml
- Event Log Anatomy: sims/event-log-anatomy/index.md
- Event Source Taxonomy: sims/event-source-taxonomy/index.md
- Normalization Pipeline: sims/normalization-pipeline/index.md
- Process Discovery Flow: sims/process-discovery/index.md

```

## Chapter 3 iframe References

The chapter `index.md` already contains iframe embeds pointing to these MicroSims:

## TODO

- [ ] Capture screenshots for social media previews (`<name>.png` in each directory)
- [ ] Test all 5 MicroSims in browser at local mkdocs serve URLs
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior at narrow widths
- [ ] Upload sketches to p5.js editor and update index.md with editor links

## Quality Scores

All MicroSims assigned initial quality_score of 80 (good documentation, missing screenshot image files and p5.js editor links).
