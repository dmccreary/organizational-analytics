# MicroSim Screenshot Capture & Index Generation Log

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Generated by:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

## Summary

Generated a comprehensive MicroSims index page with mkdocs-material grid cards and captured 63 screenshots using `~/.local/bin/bk-capture-screenshot`. Each screenshot uses the iframe height from the sim's `index.md` file for pixel-perfect dimensions.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Added YAML Frontmatter to 10 MicroSim index.md Files

These sims were missing `title:` and `description:` fields in their YAML frontmatter:

| # | MicroSim | Height |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | alert-system-architecture | 570px |
| 2 | career-path-explorer | 527px |
| 3 | executive-dashboard | 620px |
| 4 | graph-viewer | 600px |
| 5 | influence-network | 580px |
| 6 | network-patterns | 570px |
| 7 | operational-report-wireframe | 570px |
| 8 | retention-matrix | 530px |
| 9 | silo-detection | 580px |
| 10 | trend-analysis-dashboard | 570px |

### 2. Created MicroSims Index Page

**File:** `docs/sims/index.md`

- Format: mkdocs-material grid cards (`<div class="grid cards" markdown>`)
- Cards: 63 alphabetically sorted entries
- Each card: bold linked title, screenshot image, description
- Required extensions verified: `attr_list`, `md_in_html` (both present in mkdocs.yml)
- Frontmatter: title, description, `hide: toc`

### 3. Captured 63 Screenshots

**Tool:** `~/.local/bin/bk-capture-screenshot <path> <delay> <height>`

- Delay: 3 seconds for all sims (standard JS rendering time)
- Height: extracted from each sim's `index.md` iframe `height` attribute
- Width: 800px (script default)
- Output: `<sim-name>.png` in each sim directory
- Ran in 8 parallel batches for speed

All 63 captures completed successfully with zero failures.

### 4. Updated mkdocs.yml Navigation

- Added `List of MicroSims: sims/index.md` as first entry in MicroSims nav section
- Added 4 missing sims to navigation:
  - Influence Network (`sims/influence-network/index.md`)
  - Retention Priority Matrix (`sims/retention-matrix/index.md`)
  - Silo Detection Dashboard (`sims/silo-detection/index.md`)
  - Vulnerability Assessment (`sims/vulnerability-assessment/index.md`)
- Verified all 63 sim directories match nav entries (zero diff)

### 5. Created TODO.md

**File:** `docs/sims/TODO.md`

Logged all 63 sims with copy-paste-ready `bk-capture-screenshot` commands. This file is now outdated since all screenshots have been captured.

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/sims/index.md` | Grid card index page for all 63 MicroSims |
| `docs/sims/TODO.md` | Screenshot capture commands (all completed) |
| `docs/sims/*/*.png` | 63 screenshot images |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `mkdocs.yml` | Added index page to nav, added 4 missing sims |
| 10 sim `index.md` files | Added YAML frontmatter (title, description) |

## Notes

- Two sims produced very small screenshots (centrality-equity-dashboard at 2.7K, idea-flow-network at 2.5K) which may indicate the JavaScript visualization didn't fully render in 3 seconds. These may need recapture with a longer delay.
- The graph-viewer screenshot was the largest at 187K due to the dense vis-network graph with 200 nodes.
- Four sims used `height="NNN"` (without `px` suffix) in their iframe tags: course-journey-map (402), index-free-adjacency (502), relational-db-tables (442), relational-vs-graph (502). All were correctly parsed.
