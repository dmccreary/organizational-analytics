# Chapter 12 MicroSim Generation Log

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Chapter:** 12 — Recognition, Alignment, and Innovation
**Generated by:** Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

## Summary

Generated 5 p5.js MicroSims for all `#### Diagram` elements in Chapter 12. Each MicroSim uses **canvas-based controls only** (drawn with `rect()`, `text()`, handled via `mousePressed()`/`mouseDragged()`) — no p5.js DOM functions (`createButton`, `createSlider`, etc.) per project CLAUDE.md requirements. All follow the standard MicroSim directory structure with full documentation, lesson plans, and Dublin Core metadata.

## MicroSims Created

## Files Per MicroSim

Each directory contains:

- `main.html` — Entry point with p5.js 1.11.10 CDN and schema meta tag
- `<name>.js` — p5.js implementation (width-responsive, canvas-based controls)
- `index.md` — Documentation with iframe embed, fullscreen link, description, lesson plan, references
- `metadata.json` — Dublin Core metadata with educational extensions

## MicroSim Details

### 1. Hidden Achievement Detection Pipeline

- **Learning Objective:** Differentiate between formally recognized contributions and hidden achievements detectable through graph patterns, and analyze the pipeline for surfacing unrecognized contributors
- **Interactivity:** Hover stages for sample data artifact tooltips; click to highlight data flow with animated gold particles; detail panel shows stage description
- **Visual Design:** 5 horizontal pipeline stages — Communication Graph and Centrality Analysis (indigo), Recognition History Overlay and Gap Detection (amber), Recommendation Engine (gold). Annotations beneath each stage. Stage number badges.
- **Canvas:** 480px (drawHeight=440, controlHeight=40)
- **Controls:** Canvas-drawn Reset button

### 2. Strategy Alignment Graph Model

- **Learning Objective:** Connect organizational activities (tasks, projects) to strategic objectives through a layered graph model and analyze alignment patterns
- **Interactivity:** Hover strategic objectives to highlight connected subgraph; hover unaligned projects for "No strategic alignment detected" tooltip; click projects for detail panel with alignment score bar
- **Visual Design:** Three horizontal layers — Strategic Objectives (gold hexagons, top), Projects (indigo rounded rectangles, middle), Tasks (amber circles, bottom). ALIGNS_WITH edges (gold, thickness by strength 0.0-1.0), PART_OF edges (thin indigo). Unaligned projects have dashed red borders. Alignment strength badges on projects. "83% aligned" and "Alignment gap" annotations.
- **Data:** 3 strategic objectives, 6 projects (4 aligned at strengths 0.5-0.9, 2 unaligned), 14 tasks
- **Canvas:** 540px (drawHeight=500, controlHeight=40)
- **Controls:** Canvas-drawn Reset View button

### 3. Idea Flow Network Visualization

- **Learning Objective:** Assess idea flow patterns in an organizational network, identifying innovation hubs, idea deserts, and optimal diffusion pathways
- **Interactivity:** Toggle between "Idea Flow Only" and "All Communication" modes; slider for minimum idea flow weight threshold (1-5); hover for node info tooltips; drag nodes to rearrange
- **Visual Design:** Dark indigo background (#1A237E) with glowing gold idea flow edges. 20 employee nodes across 4 departments (Engineering, Product, Data Science, Marketing). Node size by idea origination count (8-25 radius). Amber gradient for high originators, gray for low. Cross-department edges in brighter gold. "Innovation Hub" label on Raj (highest originator), "Idea Desert" on Marketing.
- **Data:** 20 employees with realistic idea origination distribution; separate edge sets for idea flow and general communication
- **Canvas:** 550px (drawHeight=500, controlHeight=50)
- **Controls:** Canvas-drawn toggle button and slider with tick marks

### 4. Centrality Equity Dashboard

- **Learning Objective:** Assess centrality distribution across demographic groups, evaluate whether network structure creates equitable access to information and influence, and propose interventions
- **Interactivity:** Three metric selector buttons (Betweenness/Degree/Eigenvector) for box plot focus; toggle between "Raw Centrality" and "Tenure-Controlled" modes; hover for exact value tooltips
- **Visual Design:** Three-panel dashboard — Grouped bar chart (top, ~48%) with indigo/amber/gold bars and org-wide average lines; Box-and-whisker plot (bottom-left) with auto-scaling y-axis; Equity ratio indicators (bottom-right) color-coded green/amber/red by equity level. Professional grid lines and legend.
- **Data:** 4 demographic groups (A=312, B=287, C=156, D=93 people) with betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality. Tenure-controlled normalization factors (0.85, 1.05, 1.20, 1.30) that reduce equity gaps.
- **Canvas:** 600px (drawHeight=550, controlHeight=50)
- **Controls:** Canvas-drawn metric buttons and segmented toggle

### 5. Inclusion Network Map

- **Learning Objective:** Critique an organization's inclusion patterns by examining whether the communication network integrates diverse employees or clusters them into peripheral subgroups
- **Interactivity:** Toggle between "Segregated" and "Integrated" network configurations with smooth animated transition (lerp); hover for node details (name, group, degree centrality, integration score); click nodes to highlight connections; drag nodes
- **Visual Design:** 32 nodes colored by demographic group (Group A: indigo, B: amber, C: gold, D: green). Node size by degree centrality (8-20 radius). White border on well-integrated nodes (score > 0.6). Same-group edges thin/gray/low-opacity; cross-group edges thick/blended-color/high-opacity. Metric panel overlay shows integration score, cross-group edge ratio, centrality equity ratio.
- **Data:** Segregated config: 61 edges, 87% within-group, 8 cross-group. Integrated config: 71 edges, 48% within-group, 37 cross-group. Groups C and D peripheral in segregated, integrated in other view.
- **Canvas:** 550px (drawHeight=500, controlHeight=50)
- **Controls:** Canvas-drawn toggle button with active label highlighting

## Chapter 12 iframe References

The chapter `index.md` iframe heights were updated to match actual canvas sizes:

- Line 137: `../../sims/hidden-achievement-detection/main.html` — height="482px"
- Line 292: `../../sims/strategy-alignment-model/main.html` — height="542px"
- Line 414: `../../sims/idea-flow-network/main.html` — height="552px"

## TODO

- [ ] Capture screenshots for social media previews (`<name>.png` in each directory)
- [ ] Test all 5 MicroSims in browser at local mkdocs serve URLs
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior at narrow widths
- [ ] Upload sketches to p5.js editor and update index.md with editor links

## Quality Scores

All MicroSims assigned initial quality_score of 82 (good documentation with lesson plans and references, missing screenshot image files and p5.js editor links).

## Notes

- All 5 agents ran in parallel, completing in approximately 4 minutes
- Canvas-based control pattern used throughout: buttons drawn as rectangles with hit detection in `mousePressed()`, sliders drawn with draggable knobs handled in `mouseDragged()`
- Force-directed MicroSims (#3, #5) use the `mouseOverCanvas` animation control pattern to pause physics when mouse leaves canvas
- Inclusion Network Map uses `lerp()` for smooth transition between segregated and integrated node positions
